🚗 Car Sales Analysis Dashboard  
This project is an Excel-based dashboard that explores car sales, resale value, performance, and retention metrics. The dataset was sourced from the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate course, and the analysis was performed using pivot tables, slicers, and pivot charts only—no Power BI or Power Query involved.

📊 Project Overview  
The goal was to gain actionable insights into car model performance across manufacturers, especially focusing on Toyota models. The dashboard supports both business and technical decision-making around pricing, sales performance, and resale strategy.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Microsoft Excel** – for all data wrangling and visualization  
- **Pivot Tables** – to aggregate metrics and filter by dimensions  
- **Slicers** – for interactivity by Manufacturer, Model, and HP Level  
- **Pivot Charts** – for visual storytelling (Bar, Pie, Column, Sunburst)

📌 Dashboard Highlights  
🔹 **Manufacturer Slicer (Multi-select)**  
Selected: Audi, BMW, Mercedes-B, Volkswagen, Porsche  
🔹 **Model & HP Level Slicers (Toyota only)**  
Models: Camry, Corolla, Celica, Land Cruiser, RAV4, etc.

**Visuals & Key Insights:**  
- 🧩 **Pie Chart** – Toyota model retention %: Celica highest (13%), Land Cruiser lowest (9%)  
- ☀️ **Sunburst Chart** – Toyota unit sales: Camry leads with 247,994 units  
- 📊 **Bar Chart** – Avg. price and year resale value: Porsche highest ($62,473 / $56,475), VW lowest  
- 📈 **Column Chart** – Power Perf Factor: Land Cruiser (102.5) highest, Corolla (47.9) lowest

🔍 Deep Questions Answered  
1. **Which Toyota model offers best performance-to-price ratio?**  
   Land Cruiser leads in performance but lags in retention and sales.

2. **How do Toyota models differ in value retention?**  
   Celica retains value best, signaling high demand in used market.

3. **What are the trends in Toyota model sales?**  
   Camry and Corolla dominate, while RAV4 and Land Cruiser trail behind.

4. **How do premium manufacturers compare in price and resale?**  
   Porsche and Mercedes-B outperform Toyota models on both fronts.

🚀 What I Achieved  
- Delivered a clean Excel dashboard with dynamic filters  
- Used pivot tables and slicers for flexible analysis  
- Interpreted data to provide performance, market, and financial insights  
- Supported both business and technical narratives for decision-making

⚙️ Challenges & Solutions  
| Challenge | Solution |  
|----------|----------|  
| Managing large manufacturer/model variety | Filtered via slicers and grouped visuals |  
| Balancing visual clarity with complexity | Limited visuals to key insights per manufacturer |  
| Highlighting multiple data relationships (price, resale, performance) | Used four distinct chart types to represent each |

✅ Recommendations  
- Promote high-retention models like Celica in resale marketing  
- Reassess Land Cruiser pricing to match its low retention despite strong performance  
- Benchmark Toyota models against premium brands to adjust the value proposition
